 The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
 legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
 usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
 mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

 This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
 below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
 any of your projects or products.

   - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
     to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
     you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
     documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
     is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
     License.

     Note that  this license  is  compatible  to the  GNU General  Public
     License version 3, but not version 2.

   - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any
     later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
     GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its
     advertisement clause.

 The contributed BDF and PCF drivers  come with a license similar to that
 of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
 file src/bdf/README and  src/pcf/README).  The same holds  for the files
 `fthash.c' and  `fthash.h'; their  code was  part of  the BDF  driver in
 earlier FreeType versions.

 The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
 compatible to the above two licenses.

 The MD5 checksum support (only used for debugging in development builds)
 is in the public domain.
