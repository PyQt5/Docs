 AMSFonts (v. 2.2) copyright

 The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
 previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y, Inc. are now freely
 available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
 cooperation
 of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y.
 Members of this consortium include:

 Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
 Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)

 In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be
 held by
 the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
 the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
 distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
 into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
 applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
 faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
 removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
 any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
 Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
 has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
 given a different name.
