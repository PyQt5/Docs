<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qt Remote Objects module provides an easy way to share Qt APIs between processes and devices. For this to work, we require a data channel between processes and devices. To establish this data channel, first, you need a <a href="qremoteobjectnode.html">QRemoteObjectNode</a>.</p>
<p>In QtRO, a node is an endpoint for communication. In a remote objects network, each participant, be it a process or a device, needs its own node. QtRO is a peer-to-peer network, with connected nodes being the links in the network.</p>
<p>Nodes, by themselves, don’t provide much use. But their value comes when you add <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html">QObject</a> classes to a node to share. Then, any peer node can request a copy or instance of the shared object from the <i>host node</i>, the node that shares it.</p>
<p>Unlike when using normal class instances (with independent properties and signal emissions), QtRO automatically synchronizes changes to the shared object across all of its copies. With a few exceptions, these copies have the identical Qt API as the original object, and are meant to be used exactly as if the original object were available.</p>
<p>In QtRO, the original object is called the <a href="qtremoteobjects-source.html#source">Source</a>. It's a fully-implemented C++ class, with the necessary business logic to provide the required functionality. Copies of this object are called <a href="qtremoteobjects-replica.html#replica">Replica</a>s. You don’t need to write any C++ code for a replica; you request an instance from a node instead. While you do need some code to use the replica, such as connecting signals to your own slots, you don’t need to implement the internal behavior – that's already done for you in the source.</p>
<p>Because the source can be in a different process or even on a different device, there are factors in QtRO that you need to consider, which you typically wouldn't run into when developing without Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Specifically, what happens if the process or device isn't there? This is where the additions to the Replica API come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="qremoteobjectreplica.html#initialized">initialized()</a> signal is emitted once the replica has received the <a href="qtremoteobjects-source.html#source">source</a> state from the QtRO network.</li>
<li>Both the <a href="qremoteobjectreplica.html#isReplicaValid">isReplicaValid</a> property and the <a href="qremoteobjectreplica.html#stateChanged">stateChanged()</a> signal alert you if the connection is lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects shared over QtRO use the links (conduits) between nodes for all communication. If you want to share a <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html">QObject</a>, you must create a <i>host node</i> with a URL other nodes can connect to. You can also use the <a href="qtremoteobjects-registry.html#registry">Registry</a> to facilitate connections, but your nodes that share <a href="qtremoteobjects-source.html#source">sources</a> still need to be host nodes. Each shared object is given a name (a <a href="../qtcore/qstring.html">QString</a>), used to identify it on the QtRO network.</p>
<a name="implementation"></a>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>To illustrate the use of remote objects, on the source side, we need to:</p>
<ol class="1" type="1"><li>Create the <a href="qtremoteobjects-source.html#source">Source</a> object that is replicated to other nodes, with or without using <a href="qtremoteobjects-repc.html">repc</a>, the Qt Remote Objects Compiler.</li>
<li>Optionally, create the <a href="qtremoteobjects-registry.html#registry">Registry</a>. Otherwise, use direct connections.</li>
<li>Create a host node so that the source object can be shared.</li>
<li>Call the node's <a href="qremoteobjecthostbase.html#enableRemoting">enableRemoting()</a> function to share the source object.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the replica side, we need to:</p>
<ol class="1" type="1"><li>Optionally, use <a href="qtremoteobjects-repc.html">repc</a> to generate a <a href="qtremoteobjects-replica.html#replica">Replica</a> header for your project.</li>
<li>Create the node that will connect with the <a href="qtremoteobjects-source.html#source">Source</a> host node.</li>
<li>Call the node's <a href="qremoteobjectnode.html#acquire">acquire()</a> function to create a pointer to a replica.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following examples illustrate both <a href="qtremoteobjects-repc.html">repc</a>-compiled static objects and dynamic source objects. Additionally, they also show direct connections as well as connections that use a <a href="qtremoteobjects-registry.html#registry">Registry</a> between nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="remoteobjects-example-static-source.html">Example 1: Direct Connection using a Static Source</a></li>
<li><a href="remoteobjects-example-dynamic-replica.html">Example 2: Direct Connection with a Dynamic Replica</a></li>
<li><a href="remoteobjects-example-registry.html">Example 3: Connections to Remote Nodes using a Registry</a></li>
