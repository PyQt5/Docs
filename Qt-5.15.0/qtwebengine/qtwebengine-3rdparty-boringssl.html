 BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
 licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
 license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

 Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
 https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

 Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
 license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
 compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.

 The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e&#x2e; both the conditions of the
 OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
 for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
 licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
 openssl-core@openssl.org.

 The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
 some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
 record keeping.)
